## Layout

- **ugodoc** is a corpus: a catalog of books, manuals, articles, presentations, videos, podcasts, summaries, notes, code snippets, excerpts, websites, etc.
- *Collection* is a high-level catalogue.
- The rest of the webpages are more comprehensive.
- Since a Mkdocs site is automatically indexed, **ugodoc** becomes a searchable knowledge-based system, an entry point for searching and retrieving information. 
- Instead of counting on remembering where you classified 'something' in your computer files or personal library, you build yourself a proper 'docs'.
- You type a keyword, it leads to several sources.
- You roll back to the document and you go retrieve this source in your computer files or library. Fast and easy!
- For example, you search for a code snippet. You remember the snippet is available in one of your book, but where exactly? You type in a keyword, the website will return several excerpts. You select one excerpt and seek out the document it is associate with: a file, a book, chapter x, etc. You now know where to get what you are looking for. Fast and easy once in place.
- For that matter, *generously* adding keywords to the 'docs' is crucial (adding them in subscript makes them stand apart).
- Citations, keywords, links, etc.; they all provide leads.
- The corpus is unstructured. There is no unique chapter dedicated to one topic.
- Knowledge is rather cumulated, layer after layer, resulting in a hotchpotch of information. 
- Information may be repeted among many documents, with different explanations, some more comprehensive.
- Older entries might also supplement or contradict newer entries.
